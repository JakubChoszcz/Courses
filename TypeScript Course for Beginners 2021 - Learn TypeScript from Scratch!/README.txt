TypeScript takes JavaScript and adds new Features.

Browser can't execute TypeScript and Node.js.

TypeScript is a programming language, powerfull compiler, it gives extra error checking too.

Inputs in JS always have typeof = string

TS's type system only helps you during development (before the code gets compiled).

The key difference is: JS uses 'dynamic types' (resolved at runtime), TS uses 'static types' (set during development).
